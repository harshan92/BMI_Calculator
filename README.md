# BMI_Calculator
Android Studio Kotlin

This is an alpha Version app. To build this app I used android studio 3.4 versions. I tested it on. This is a very small app. 
Only I added few fuctionalities.

The body mass index (BMI) or Quetelet index is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of an individual. 
The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is universally expressed in units of kg/m2, 
resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.
